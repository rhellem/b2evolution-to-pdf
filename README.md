# b2evolution-to-pdf
This project is the result of my effort to export my B2Evolution-blog http://b2evolution.net/ to PDF. The project is written in Java, using the iText-library http://itextpdf.com, to create a PDF-document with text and images. The layout is two column, but this is off course fully customizable thanks to iText.  Currently only creating a PDF-document with two columns, see example pdf found in SVN http://code.google.com/p/b2evolution-to-pdf/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fexample Features to add if someone else would be interested in the code would be to have the layout-code in separate classes pr. layout
